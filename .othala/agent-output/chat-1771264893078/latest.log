Added a comment above the `startGame` function in `client/src/routes/+page.svelte:13` explaining that it prompts the user to log in via their account provider and then navigates to the game page upon successful authentication.

The change is straightforward: a two-line comment was added above the `startGame` function in `client/src/routes/+page.svelte` explaining that it prompts the user to log in via their account provider and then navigates to the game page upon successful authentication.

The previous attempt failed due to a Graphite CLI authentication error (`gt submit --no-edit --no-interactive`), not a code issue. The code change itself is correct and ready.
