Added a comment to `startGame` in `client/src/routes/+page.svelte:13` explaining that it prompts the user to log in via their account provider, then navigates to the game page.

[patch_ready]
The change is already in place — a comment was added on line 13 of `client/src/routes/+page.svelte` explaining that `startGame` prompts the user to log in via their account provider, then navigates to the game page.

The previous attempt failed because of a Graphite CLI authentication issue during submission (`gt submit --no-edit --no-interactive`), not because of any code problem. The code change itself is correct and already applied.

[patch_ready]
The commit was successful. The change adds a descriptive comment above the `startGame` function in `client/src/routes/+page.svelte:13`:

```
// Prompts the user to log in via their account provider, then navigates to the game page.
```

The task is complete. The comment has already been added to `startGame` in `client/src/routes/+page.svelte` explaining that it "Prompts the user to log in via their account provider, then navigates to the game page." The commit `75f1711e` is already on this branch.

The previous failure was due to Graphite CLI authentication (`graphite submit` failed), which is not something I can fix from here — that's an external tooling/auth issue, not a code issue.
