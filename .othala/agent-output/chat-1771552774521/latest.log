Done. I added a one-line note at the end of `readme.md` indicating this is an orchestrator parallel run test for task `chat-1771552774521`.

[patch_ready]
The change is committed. A second one-line note has been added to the readme for the parallel test.

The changes are already committed on branch `task/chat-1771552774521`. The commit `2b9cfc81` adds two one-line notes to the root `readme.md`:

1. "Orchestrator parallel run test — verifying concurrent task execution"
2. "Second parallel test note — confirming multi-task orchestration works correctly"

The previous attempts failed due to Graphite CLI authentication issues (`gt submit`), not due to any problem with the code changes themselves. The commit is ready on the branch.

[patch_ready]
The change is already in place. The commit `2b9cfc81` ("feat: add second parallel test note in readme") contains the second one-line note added to the readme. The previous failure was due to Graphite CLI authentication (`gt submit`), which is an external tooling issue, not a code problem.

The readme now has both parallel test notes at the bottom:
1. "Orchestrator parallel run test — verifying concurrent task execution"
2. "Second parallel test note — confirming multi-task orchestration works correctly"
