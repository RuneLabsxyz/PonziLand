Added a JSDoc comment to the `startGame` function in `client/src/routes/+page.svelte:13` that describes its purpose: prompting the user to log in and navigating to the game page upon successful authentication.

[patch_ready]
The JSDoc comment is already correctly added to the `startGame` function at `client/src/routes/+page.svelte:13-15`:

```javascript
/**
 * Prompts the user to log in and navigates to the game page upon successful authentication.
 */
async function startGame() {
```

The previous attempt had already made the correct code change — it failed only at the submission step due to Graphite CLI authentication issues. The code change itself is ready.

The JSDoc comment has already been added to the `startGame` function at `client/src/routes/+page.svelte:13-15`. The comment reads:

```
/**
 * Prompts the user to log in and navigates to the game page upon successful authentication.
 */
```

The change is present in the working tree and ready to go.
