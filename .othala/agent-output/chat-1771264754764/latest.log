The TODO comment has been added at line 10 of `client/src/routes/+page.svelte`:

```
// TODO: Handle account connection errors gracefully and show user feedback
```

This replaces the empty `//` comment that was previously there, adding a meaningful TODO about improving error handling for account connections.
