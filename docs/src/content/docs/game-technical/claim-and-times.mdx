title: Claim & Nukes
description: Claim and Nukes are handled in a special way by the game's mechanics.
---

## Objectives (temp)

- Explain that each of the neighbors have a different counter
- When claimed, tries two paths
  - Either a simple (if the earliest claim * tax rate is greater than remaining stake)
  - Or a more complex (otherwise)
- Explain how the other path is calculated, using the filling bucket principle
- On nuke, claim is executed on that nuked land to guarantee taxes, along with sending final pay to all neighbors
- No further nukes, only taking the required amount of money from neighbors

## Assets required

- Bucketlike pixel art (empty, can be filled)
- Stopwatches with different levels of filling
- Land and neighbors (separated)
- Colored arrows (red & blue)
